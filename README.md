This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Simple React App that shows a list that comes from a JSON, when you click on the title it updates another component to show the Youtube video for the song you selected.

The communication between components was made with Redux.

When you clone the repository, you first need to `npm install` and then `npm start`
